This project represents a security system to be exploited with a rasberryPi The goal here is to simulate a security system with a Tkintrer interface and a set of LEDs with the Python language on our Rasberry Pi and record the times when the LEDs (ON = represents that something has been detected and therefore the led lights up and the opposite in OFF) turn on or off and save it in a SQLSERVER database with a Node server to pass our data.
